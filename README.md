# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis – PwC Virtual Internship

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **PwC Switzerland Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience**.  
The goal was to analyze customer churn data for a telecom client, identify the key factors driving churn and design a Power BI dashboard that visualizes insights for strategic decision-making.  

---

## Objectives
- Understand and calculate customer **churn rate** and its impact on business performance.  
- Identify key drivers of churn such as contract type, payment method, and tenure.  
- Visualize churn patterns and KPIs in an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve customer retention and satisfaction.  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data exploration and cleaning   
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development and visualization  

---

## Data Preparation
The dataset (7,043 customer records) contained customer demographics, contract details and service usage data.  
Using Power Query and SQL, I performed:
- **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values and corrected inconsistencies.  
- **Data Transformation** – Created calculated fields (e.g., churn rate, tenure categories).  
- **Data Standardization** – Ensured uniform formats for dates and categorical values.

Key visual features:
- **Churn Overview:** KPIs for total customers, churn % and average monthly charges.  
- **Contract Type Analysis:** Comparison of churn rates across month-to-month, one-year, and two-year contracts.  
- **Payment Methods:** Visualization of churn distribution by payment type.  
- **Customer Demographics:** Breakdown by gender, senior citizen status, and partner/dependent status.  
- **Service Preferences:** Insights into fiber optic users and their churn trends.

## Key Insights
- **Contract Type:** Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate (~24%), while 2-year contracts show strong retention (only 1% churn).  
- **Customer Tenure:** Churn decreases as tenure increases — long-term customers are more loyal.  
- **Senior Citizens:** More likely to churn, indicating a need for specialized engagement strategies.  
- **Gender Trends:** Female customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit higher churn rates than males.  
- **Payment Method:** Manual payment users churn more frequently — automatic payments could improve retention.  
- **Service Demand:** Fiber optic internet is most popular but shows a higher churn segment.  

---

## Recommendations
- **Promote Long-Term Contracts:** Offer incentives for customers to shift from monthly to annual plans.  
- **Enhance Senior Engagement:** Develop programs tailored for senior citizens.  
- **Focus on Female Retention:** Personalize offers and communication for female customers with high churn risk.  
- **Automate Payments:** Encourage digital and auto-pay methods to reduce churn linked to manual billing.  
- **Monitor Fiber Optic Customers:** Investigate dissatisfaction factors behind their higher churn rate.
